# SwiftHablaré Development Methodology

## Overview

This document defines the phased, gated development methodology for SwiftHablaré v2.0. Each phase includes specific deliverables, quality gates, and testing requirements that must be met before proceeding to the next phase. This ensures comprehensive coverage of all requirements defined in REQUIREMENTS.md.

## Methodology Principles

1. **Gated Progression**: Each phase must pass all quality gates before the next phase begins
2. **Requirements Traceability**: Every requirement maps to specific tests and deliverables
3. **Incremental Validation**: Testing happens continuously, not just at the end
4. **AI-First Design**: Documentation and templates tested with AI code builders throughout
5. **Community Validation**: Early community involvement through feedback and testing

## Phase 6: Typed Return Data

**Duration**: 3-4 weeks
**Goal**: Implement typed return data support with schema validation

### Overview

**API Requestor Definition**: An API Requestor is a request-based interface to a local or remote AI system provider. Individual provider implementations provide a standardized interface for requesting typed data from AI-generated sources.

**Provider Types**: Generic provider categories based on output type:
- Audio Provider (e.g., ElevenLabs, Apple TTS) - not "voice provider"
- Text Provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Image Provider (e.g., DALL-E, Midjourney)
- Video Provider, etc.

**Configuration Widget Pattern**: Each API Requestor must provide a configuration widget for request parameters:
- Audio Provider: voice selection, audio parameters
- Image Provider: prompt input, style parameters
- Text Provider: model selection, temperature, etc.
- Multi-type Providers: type selection + type-specific configuration

**UI Component Pattern**: Three-view pattern for displaying AI responses:
1. **List View**: Filterable list of all responses
2. **Detail View**: Individual response detail display
3. **Combined View**: List with click-to-reveal detail functionality

### Deliverables

#### Core Implementation
- [ ] Typed response schema system
- [ ] Request-level type specification (specify expected return type per request)
- [ ] Schema validation for returned data
- [ ] Type-safe data extraction from provider responses
- [ ] Error handling for missing typed data
- [ ] Error handling for invalid/malformed typed data
- [ ] Support for JSON schema, Pydantic-style models, or Swift Codable types
- [ ] Provider capability declarations for supported return types
- [ ] Type conversion and validation middleware
- [ ] TextPack coordinator actor: Thread-safe coordination for TextPack bundle modifications
- [ ] API Requestor protocol: Standardized interface for requesting typed data from AI providers
- [ ] Configuration widget requirement: Each API requestor must provide a SwiftUI configuration widget
  - Audio providers: voice selection, audio format, speed, pitch, etc.
  - Image providers: prompt input, size, style, quality parameters
  - Text providers: model selection, temperature, max tokens, system prompts
  - Multi-type providers: type selection dropdown + dynamic type-specific configuration
- [ ] SwiftData model requirements: Each API requestor must provide its own SwiftData table/model for storing typed data
- [ ] SwiftUI display requirements: Three-view pattern implementation (list, detail, combined)
  - Filterable list view of all AI responses
  - Detail view for individual AI response display
  - Combined view with click-to-reveal detail functionality

#### Concurrency and Performance Requirements
- [ ] Request execution: All AI requests must execute on background threads (never on main thread)
- [ ] Response persistence: All SwiftData writes must occur on the main thread
- [ ] Thread communication: Use Sendable protocol for all data passed between background and main threads
- [ ] Large data handling: Typed data exceeding main thread performance threshold must be written to filesystem
- [ ] File write location: Large data file writes must occur on background threads (never transfer large data to main thread)
- [ ] File write coordination: Use actor or appropriate synchronization for thread-safe TextPack bundle modifications
- [ ] File reference transfer: Only small file references/paths transferred between threads, not large data payloads
- [ ] File storage format: .guion is a TextPack file (compressed TextBundle format per https://textbundle.org)
- [ ] **File storage abstraction**: All file read/write operations abstracted through .guion document interface
- [ ] **Unique ID file storage**: Files stored in Resources folder with unique IDs (UUID-based naming)
- [ ] **File reference structure**: File references contain unique ID for retrieval from .guion Resources folder
- [ ] File references: Large data stored as file references in the typed data Sendable object
- [ ] **Performance measurement**: Record performance metrics for in-memory vs file-based storage (thresholds TBD)
- [ ] TextPack compliance: Follow TextBundle/TextPack specification for .guion file structure
- [ ] Workflow pattern: background request → background file write → file reference to main → SwiftData persistence
- [ ] **SwiftGuion integration**: Use SwiftGuion library (https://github.com/intrusive-memory/SwiftGuion) as the native format for TextPack bundles
- [ ] **Provider-specific storage**: Individual providers decide how their data is stored within the .guion TextPack bundle structure

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
1. **AI Service API Changes**: Providers may change APIs
   - **Mitigation**: Abstraction layer, version-specific implementations

2. **SwiftData Complexity**: Complex data models may be challenging
   - **Mitigation**: Incremental testing, clear examples

3. **Performance at Scale**: Large responses or many providers
   - **Mitigation**: Early performance testing, profiling

4. **AI Builder Documentation**: Docs may not work for AI assistants
   - **Mitigation**: Continuous AI builder testing throughout

5. **Community Adoption**: Community may not contribute
   - **Mitigation**: Low barrier to entry, good examples, active support

### Phase-Specific Risks

| Phase | Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|------|--------|------------|
| Phase 1 | Protocol design flaws | High | External architecture review |
| Phase 2 | SwiftData migration issues | High | Extensive migration testing |
| Phase 3 | Rate limiting too restrictive | Medium | Configurable rate limits |
| Phase 4 | Keychain integration complexity | Medium | Early security review |
| Phase 5 | Provider API instability | High | Mock providers for testing |
| Phase 6 | UI complexity | Medium | Incremental component building |
| Phase 7 | Documentation inadequacy | High | External reviews, AI testing |
| Phase 9 | Low beta adoption | Medium | Active outreach, incentives |
